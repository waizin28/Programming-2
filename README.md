# Programming-2
Projects from CS300

## Project 1 - Self-Checkout Kiosk
- Develop a simple self-checkout application for a grocery store. The checkout process takes place after the customer finishes shopping and is ready to scan and check out the items in their shopping cart. We are going to use Java Arrays to implement this application.

## Project 2 - Memory Match Game
- Develop a simple card matching game. We will use the Processing library to build the Graphical User Interface and interact with the player. Our game is a one player memory game in which 12 cards are initially laid face down on a surface. Each turn, the player selects two faced down cards, which are then flipped over. If the two cards match, they remain faced up. Otherwise, they are both flipped back to face down. When the player successfully turns all the cards up, the program will declare him a Winner of the game.

## Project 3 - Room Reservations
- Implement a room reservation system using Object-Oriented design, to make sure we’re effectively tracking how people are utilizing the spaces on campus for learning and studying.

## Project 4 - Carrot Patch
- Development of a graphic application from the scratch. This will give you practice with implementing interfaces, and defining an hierarchy of classes including super classes, and subclasses. We’ll also work on improving the organization and clarity of your code. Having this programming assignment as reference, you will also be able to develop your own graphical application using the processing library, from the scratch.

## Project 5 - Simple Benchmarking
- Implementing different methods to test out run time complexity

## Project 6 - Palindromes
- Recursive exploration of palindromes. Reads the same regardless of whether the letters are written forward or backward. Some examples include “rotator”, “racecar”, and even phrases like “do geese see god” (palindromic phrases tend to allow for creative placement of spaces).

## Project 7 - Inventory Storage System
- Implementation of a simple inventory storage system. An inventory storage system helps businesses to store, manage, and track inventory. There are several different ways to store inventory and properly manage it. In this programming assignment, we will store and manage inventory using a singly linked list defined by its head, its tail, its size, and different count fields to keep track of some statistics. This inventory storage list stores boxes of three colors: YELLOW, BLUE, and BROWN.

## Project 8 - Order Up!
- Implement a basic linked queue system to store Orders for a restaurant.

## Project 9
- Movie Theater seating system

## Project 10 - Order Up! v2.
- Creating a queue of Orders (in fact, almost exactly the same Order class as before). This time, though, we’re going to impose a priority on them - anything that takes longer to prep gets to move to the front of the queue and start first. Using an array-based heap.
